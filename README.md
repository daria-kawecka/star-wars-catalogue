# Star Wars CatalogueðŸŒŒ

Let the force be with you, jedi... I mean front-end developer!

App written in **React.js**. Layout created with **styled-components** and 3rd party library called **react-big-bang-star-field** (there is a memo error, I know ðŸ˜” ). All jedi-and-not-jedi data provided by https://swapi.dev/ fetched using **axios**. Additionally, I used **react-transition-group** to create... transitions of course. I deployed solution on github-pages, so I had to used **cors-bridge**
